Scaffolding creates a model along with it's associated views, and controllers files. The controller file comes built with associated CRUD methods, and the view files have templates preloaded to display the data. On top of all that, it creates rspec tests that further confirm that they work. 

We don't want to use scaffolding because it pre-renders files that would only be appropriate for a very basic app. This would not be appropriate for apps who's functionality is different from the cookie-cutter builds. The delete functionality wouldn't be good for public use.
